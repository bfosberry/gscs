{"name":"GSCS","tagline":"Game Server Container Specification","body":"Running a game server inside a linux container is not an easy task. This specification is aimed at standardizing game server containers to both simplify the process of containerizing a game server, and also increase compatibility between different containers. \r\n\r\n## Mission\r\nA lot of similarities exist between game servers, and as such there are many opportunities for abstraction. By adhering to a specification for a game server container, with a well defined interface, we can make composable, pluggable containers, for different types of game servers. The Game Server Container Specification aims to provide json schemas, documentation and guidelines, and also tooling around creating containers for game servers, in order to standardize the configuration, deployment and management process.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo start building game server containers with the specification, check out the project wiki: https://github.com/bfosberry/gscs/wiki\r\n\r\nTo start deploying game servers in containers, see the [repo registry](https://github.com/bfosberry/gscs/wiki/Repository-Registry) page, and follow the guidelines on [deploying a game server container](https://github.com/bfosberry/gscs/wiki/Deploying-a-game-server-container)","google":"UA-60792926-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
