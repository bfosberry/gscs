{"name":"GSCS","tagline":"Game Server Container Specification","body":"Running a game server inside a linux container is not an easy task. This specification is aimed at standardizing game server containers to both simplify the process of containerizing a game server, and also increase compatibility between different containers. \r\n\r\n# Mission\r\nA lot of similarities exist between game servers, and as such there are many opportunities for abstraction. By adhering to a specification for a game server container, with a well defined interface, we can make composable, pluggable containers, for different types of game servers. The Game Server Container Specification aims to provide json schemas, documentation and guidelines, and also tooling around creating containers for game servers, in order to standardize the configuration, deployment and management process.\r\n\r\n## Example repos\r\n\r\nTo see some examples of the specification in action, check out these repos:\r\n* [Garry's Mod](https://github.com/bfosberry/gmod_server)","google":"UA-60792926-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
